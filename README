The purpose of these icons are to facilitate the adoption and usage of microformat 
standards as a dual-purpose vCard download-link and hCard-indicator.

Many microformat indicator graphics (icons, buttons, etc) are optimized to boldly 
stand out and command-attention. Sometimes a "more elegant" approach is needed:

Ex.1
----
"vCard.xsm.png" is intended to integrate cleanly and easily into a website
footer or anywhere within in-line text. As a usage example, replace Name:

HTML:
<a href="/Name.vcf" rel="external nofollow noindex" title="We look forward to hearing from you: Click to Download the Name vCard for your Address Book!   (This page also integrates an hCard to make connecting easier.)"><img class="vCard" src="/img/vCard.xsm.png" alt="vCard" /></a>

CSS: (as needed)
"IMG.vCard {position:relative; top:1px;}
