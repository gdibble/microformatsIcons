  Good Usablity will facilitate the adoption & usage of microformat online!


Such is the purpose of these icons which represent:
  (1) vCard download-link - visually representation of a 'contact'
  (2) indicate the presence of hCard(s).

This icon provides visual interest and the hint of 'contact', wrapped by a
link it tells us it 'goes somewhere' and the title attribute explains 'this
is a download' and 'hCard data is available' if desired.

Many microformat indicator icons and buttons are visually optimized to boldly
stand out & command-attention. Sometimes a "more elegant" approach is needed:

Ex.1  ~  Replace Name in this usage example:

  "vCard.xsm.png" is intended to integrate cleanly & easily
  into a website footer or anywhere within in-line text:

  HTML:
<a href="/Name.vcf" rel="external nofollow noindex" title="We look forward to hearing from you: Click to Download the Name vCard for your Address Book!   (This page also integrates an hCard to make connecting easier.)"><img class="vCard" src="/img/vCard.xsm.png" alt="vCard" /></a>

  CSS: (as needed)
IMG.vCard {position:relative; top:1px;}
